# BlueWork
This was an idea. A messy, over thought, and ambitious idea. Its not the most performant or the most intuitive. It is missing many major features that would make it useful, but it was a damn good learning experience. Hopefully someone will find it useful in learning some interesting ideas and learning from some bad ideas.

### It has:
* a basic scene loading system
* shadows
* over-thought scene graph
* under-thought shadow rendering (but the soft shadows look pretty decent)
* a no-entity component system, because who needs entities anyway... or memory management, or performance, or a component system that makes sense
